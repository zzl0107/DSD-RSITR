# DSD-RSITR
This project is built upon [HarMA](https://github.com/seekerhuang/HarMA). Please refer to the original repository for instructions on data preparation, training, and evaluation. We added single-GPU training support in `run.py`.

The pretrained CLIP model is loaded using [OpenCLIP](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip). If the weights fail to load automatically, you can manually download them from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-B-32-laion2B-s34B-b79K).
