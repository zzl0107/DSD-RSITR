# DSD-RSITR
This project is built upon [HarMA]([https://your-link-here.com](https://github.com/seekerhuang/HarMA)). Please refer to the original repository for instructions on data preparation, training, and evaluation.  
We added single-GPU training support in `run.py` to facilitate debugging and quick testing.
